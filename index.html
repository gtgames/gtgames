<p>I also work on smaller projects from time to time:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thepapercraneproject.my-expressions.com">The Paper Crane Project</a>: Liz Shuman from Boston sent out 1000 cranes to people from all over the world. The project started on Flickr, and was based on the idea that people would send back photos and prints of the cranes in their new habitat. Together with <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net">Be A Good Girl</a> whose responsible for the design, I set up a photoblog on my-expressions.com and built the website and some client-side logic.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com">Bratwurst On Rails</a>: I wrote a small application to allow for registration for a <a href="http://www.paperplanes.de/archives/2007/6/15/announcing_bratwurst_on_rails/">pre-conference event</a> for the <a href="http://www.railsconfeurope.com">RailsConf Europe 2007</a> in Berlin. Design again by <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net">Be A Good Girl</a>, implementation by PAPERPLANES.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.astridhagen.no">Astrid Hagen</a>: Astrid Hagen is a journalist from Bergen, Norway. Together with <a href="http://www.beagoodgirl.net">Be A Good Girl</a> I implemented an archiving blog to present her past and recent work together with photos, since she's both an excellent journalist and photographer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cupcakeberlin.de">Cupcake Berlin</a>: Berlin's first Cupcake shop. Though the cupcake itself is not yet a common "snack" in Germany, the new website for Cupcake Berlin will help spread the word. Integrating Google Maps and a simple blogging system, it presents facts, news and the shop's menu. I highly recommend paying a visit. You won't regret it.</li>
</ul>
